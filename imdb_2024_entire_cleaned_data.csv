He soon realizes that Lembembe's murder is no isolated case. Same-gender sexual orientation is still a criminal offense in Cameroon, as it is in almost all African countries. Being gay is completely taboo and is considered an embarrassment for families. While making the film, Siewe examines his own homophobic upbringing and seeks contact with members of his family. Since living in Europe, his outlook has changed. For his father, on the other hand, making a film on the subject is enough for him to break off all contact. Why is homophobia so firmly anchored in Cameroon's society? What role does colonization have to play in this? Siewe's own experiences, moving encounters with activists who fight for tolerance in their country despite all the risks, and his conversations with Cameroonian scientists, sociologists, and human rights activists offer a comprehensive insight into society in Cameroon."

Beim Versuch, Ida zurückzuerobern, steht Albin deren jagdbegeisterter Vater Dr. Hampapa (Clemens Aap Lindenberg) im Weg, der ihn nicht ausstehen kann und nicht nur gerne Hasen schießt. Bis sich zum toten Naturalismus ein toter Naturalist gesellt, der sich dann doch als jemand anderer herausstellt - und die Dinge immer gruseliger werden. Wie es eben geht, wenn man etwas zu tief hinter gutbürgerliche Fassaden blickt. Im Haus der alten Augustin beginnt lustig und endet ernsthaft. Oder eher: beginnt mit Kunst und endet im Blut. Doch waren Spaß und Ernst, Kunst und Blut je wirklich getrennt? Ist, in einem Land wie Österreich, das Verrückte nicht immer schon das Authentische und umgekehrt? Man nehme das Hermann-Nitsch-Bild, das sich Dr. Hampapa ins Esszimmer gehängt hat, weil er, wie er sagt, es sich leisten kann. Albin, der als ""Naturalist"" Nitsch verachtet, empört sich: ""Einen Kübel Blut über die Leinwand schütten und für eine Million Schilling an irgendwelche Kunstbanausen verkaufen? Da scheiß ich drauf, Oida."" Die Blutorgie der modernen Kunst wird zum Vorboten eines Schreckens, der im Patriarchen Dr. Hampapa seine perfekte Verkörperung findet.

A highly original cross-disciplinary artist, Schloss was known for her boundary-pushing, idiosyncratic performance art, video, and installations. Through exclusive never-before-seen archival footage shot by Schloss herself and mixed with commentary from people from the scene, we trace Schloss's story and see, from her point of view, the texture of New York City's downtown art scene from the 1970s through the 1990s. Known as an ""artist's artist,"" Schloss became influential through A's, her loft space that was a hub for genre-defying music, gallery shows, performance art, films, and other happenings. A hotbed of experimentation, A's featured the work of Jean-Michel Basquiat, Eric Bogosian, Glenn Branca, Kim Gordon, Shirin Neshat, Thurston Moore, Alan Suiclde, Ai Wei Wei, and John Zorn, among others. In addition to the shows she curated at A's and elsewhere, Schloss gained notice as a critically acclaimed performance artist in the 1970s. A New York Times critic once described her multimedia productions as ""much superior to most performance art."" Her shows, along with A's, established Schloss as a prolific connector who brought people together from both the underground and more mainstream creative communities. In the 1980s and 1990s, Schloss became one of the first artists to integrate technology and lasers into her performance art. Schloss was frequently one of the first in a group of artists to integrate new technologies, including digital video into her projects. She evolved into a successful video artist and made inroads into other forms of digital media during the dotcom boom of the 1990s and early aughts. Continually challenging herself to create no matter the prevailing conditions, Schloss remains a transformative figure and an inspiring force in the lives of many artists and creatives. She mentored and supported up-and-coming artists from all over the world through the 2010s."

Our whole family recognized them, and I was drawn to his vision and the secret paths it opened up into our family history and the story of these images. It was at Orly Airport that we arrived from Algeria in 1962. As for Marker... Because images imprint themselves on our consciousness, films can and do belong to us. And few films have been more dear to history than Chris Marker's La Jetée (1962), a minimalist masterpiece often ranked among the greatest and most influential. But as acclaimed director Dominique Cabrera belatedly discovers in her latest feature, Marker's science-fiction photo-montage might also be an unwitting historical document about her own family. La Jetée was made the very year Algerian independence was declared, and at a time when hundreds of thousands of French people of Algerian descent, like Cabrera's family, were retreating to Paris via Orly Airport. Sixty years later, the director's cousin is convinced that it is he who appears in the fifth frame of the film, standing next to his parents as they greet their loved ones at the airport. A detective novel ensues, revealing evidence about their family, French colonialism, Marker, and the film itself.

In her letters to Max, Rusha recounts daily life in the city. This creates a vivid image of Amsterdam during the interwar period, from the perspective of the Jewish community. The film begins shortly after World War I, a period full of confidence in the future. The combination of Rusha's letters and archival footage creates a colorful portrait of proud diamond cutters; haggling traders at the flea market; cabaret artists with songs that everyone sings along to; city officials like De Miranda, who are committed to social housing; and the entrepreneurs behind warehouse De Bijenkorf, the luxurious Amstel Hotel, and cinema Tuschinski. These stories illustrate the importance of the Jewish community to the city. The initial optimism after World War I is gradually tested by a severe economic depression and the rise of fascism, leading to the occupation of The Netherlands. Humor and zest for life, the ""lechajim,"" provide comfort to the Jews in times of adversity. Against this backdrop, Rusha grows from a young girl into an independent woman, lovingly navigating between the ideas of her socialist father and the religious beliefs of her husband. The outbreak of World War II presents her with an impossible choice. Neshoma is not only about the lives of those who are no longer here, but also about what they have left behind: the Jewish soul of Amsterdam, the neshoma."

I Could Not Believe It joyously chronicles the experiences of a young Black, queer creative finding their identity, voice and style decades before Barry Jenkins' (rather more downbeat) Moonlight. The Life of Sean DeLear is a vibrantly multi-faceted, buoyantly propulsive documentary portrait of this irresistibly charismatic one-off - sketched in celebratory but commendably clear-eyed style by writer-director Markus Zizenbacher. There can be very few people better qualified to do justice to this particular tale. Zizenbacher befriended DeLear - born Anthony Robertson in Simi Valley, an obscure California backwater - after the latter relocated to Vienna in the early 2010s. There the former front-person of Silver Lake post-punk-combo Glue reinvented themselves as a cabaret performer and collaborated with famed art-collective Gelitin before passing away aged just 52. ""SeanDe"" entrusted their treasure-trove audiovisual archive to Zizenbacher, who with co-editor Sebastian Schreiner has crafted an eclectic collage generously spiced with effervescent extracts from DeLear's own extensive video-diaries. These jagged hand-held snapshots bring back to often-hilarious life the electric days (and especially nights) from a quarter of a century ago, placed in retrospective context by present-day testimony from the survivors who knew SeanDe best and loved them the most. Sean DeLear - as in ""chandelier"" - lit up their world; Markus Zizenbacher now illuminates Sean DeLear for ours."

After a century of colonialist rule, Haida culture was nearly obliterated, with language and traditions fading, and the land stripped of its resources. But a committed group of Haida and their supporters took a stand, demanding a stop to clear-cut logging practices that had destroyed salmon habitat and ravaged old-growth forest. In the face of overwhelming pressure from the RCMP, private logging interests and even the media, the defenders called for the government to work with Indigenous people to find a way to protect the land and the future. In a riveting new feature documentary drawn from more than a hundred hours of archival footage and audio, award-winning director Christopher Auchter (Now Is the Time (2019)) recreates the courage, tenacity and tension of this critical turning point. From furious showdowns between television pundit Jack Webster and Haida leader Miles Richardson, to the support of then-NDP MLA Svend Robinson, The Stand captures the struggle as it unfolds on a moment-to-moment basis. As a complex battle played out on remote logging roads, in the legal system and in the court of public opinion, authorities staged a steady propaganda campaign, alongside stalling tactics and a police presence, to undermine the Haida cause. With the whole world watching, would the Haida hold fast to their strategy of peaceful resistance, or would violence erupt? The parallels between past and present continue to resound, as the Lyell Island blockade laid the foundations for current land-claim treaties across Canada. From the Haida Nation's resolute act of vision and conscience emerged an unbreakable commitment to justice, solidarity and Indigenous sovereignty that echoes forth to this day."

She embarked on an arduous journey to find her own tribe and live her truth. With a biological father that tries to kidnap her, a predatory priest, and a mother who doesn't understand what is wrong with her son, Tuesday had to leave home to become the person she knew she was inside. She finds friends and foes in the LGBTQ+ community, the one place she should be safe but wasn't always. Doing shows to make money, she was getting hormones wherever she could: including black markets and shady doctors. All this at a time when trans health-care was 'unofficial' and deadly, if it existed at all. After all, the median age for trans women at the time was said to be only 35. After surviving sexual assaults, outing, drug addiction and more she thought she'd found happiness and got married in Vegas. However, her husband soon reveals himself to be a drug-addicted lunatic who leaves her sick and alone. Tuesday goes home to recover, where she reconnects with the family she once felt so alienated from. While trying to divorce her husband, he begins to stalk and harass her, chasing her across the country for almost a decade, including orchestrating a conspiracy to have her killed for the insurance money. Finally, after he gets deported back to Canada, Tuesday faces her final battle. The breast implants Tuesday had gotten over 20 years ago break and start poisoning her with silicone. Ultimately, due to inadequate health care, death-for-profit insurance companies, and Transphobia running rampant in health care, Tuesday is forced to flee the country to get the medical care she needs to survive. Following the COVID-19 lock-down, Tuesday triumphantly returns to the stage. She knows the only reason she has survived while so many of her kind have perished, is to make people happy and heal them through laughter. As Tuesday says, ""There aren't many trans women who are left at this age."" Tuesday shares her story so that future generations can learn from her rare wisdom, and to honor all her friends who have been lost along the way who are unable to share their own."
